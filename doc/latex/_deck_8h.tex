A class representing a deck of playing cards. This class is abstract and can be used as a base class for other decks with different rules for dealing cards and shuffling. Many function has a default implementation that can be overridden by subclasses. This is because the rules of the deck can be different depending on the game. example\+: A deck of cards with the following rules\+:
